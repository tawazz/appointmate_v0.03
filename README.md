meeting managment system

AppointMate is a booking system which serves to address the inefficiency of the current manual process in place within

Murdoch when a meeting convener needs to organise a series of meetings with a number of students.

Once AppointMate is deployed, it will be able to eliminate the monotonous and inefficient procedures to book 

appointments which typically involves a large amount of back and forth emails and calls with the organizerâ€™s and 

attendees and it will save a substantial amount of time to book meetings with Students.   These meetings could be 

with over 50 students and take weeks to organise and the AppointMate system would take an organizer less than 

half an hour to organise such meetings, not to mention the additional benefits of record keeping.

The System was developed with:

- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Jquery
- Outlook intergration
